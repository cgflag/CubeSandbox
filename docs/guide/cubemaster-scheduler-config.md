# CubeMaster Scheduler Configuration

This page explains where CubeMaster scheduler configuration lives, how CubeMaster selects compute nodes, how Cubelet-reported metadata affects scheduling, and how one-click / Terraform deployment variables map to scheduling behavior.

If you only need basic multi-node scoring, start with [Multi-Node Cluster Deployment](./multi-node-deploy.md#configure-cubemaster-scheduler-scoring). Use this page as the complete reference when debugging scheduling failures, resource exhaustion, node-label mismatches, template locality, or template synchronization after adding compute nodes.

## Where configuration lives

CubeMaster scheduler configuration is stored in CubeMaster's `conf.yaml`:

| Deployment | Config location | How to apply |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| one-click / systemd | `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/CubeMaster/conf.yaml` | Restart `cube-sandbox-cubemaster.service` |
| source config template | `configs/single-node/cubemaster.yaml` | Rebuild the bundle or copy it into the runtime environment |
| Tencent Cloud Terraform / TKE | `deploy/one-click/terraform/tencentcloud/tke-addons.tf` (`kubernetes_secret.cubemaster_conf`) | Update the Terraform-generated `yamlencode` configuration, re-apply Terraform, and restart or roll cube-master Pods |
| Kubernetes / Helm chart | `deploy/kubernetes/chart/files/cube-master/conf.yaml`, rendered by `deploy/kubernetes/chart/templates/master-config-secret.yaml` | Update the chart file or rendered Secret and restart or roll cube-master Pods |

Cubelet node metadata and quota are not configured in CubeMaster. Each Cubelet reports them to CubeOps (port 3010). In one-click deployments, the main inputs are:

| Config | Location | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Cubelet static config | `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/Cubelet/config/config.toml` | Contains `node_status_update_frequency`; restart Cubelet after edits |
| Cubelet dynamic config | `/usr/local/services/cubetoolbox/Cubelet/dynamicconf/conf.yaml` | Contains `host.scheduler_label` and `host.quota`; restart Cubelet after edits |

Common Cubelet dynamic config:

```yaml
host:
  scheduler_label: "default-cluster"
  quota:
    mcpu_limit: 0
    mem_limit: ""
    mvm_limit: 0
    creation_concurrent_num: 0
```

`0` or an empty value usually means Cubelet derives a default from host resources. It does not mean unlimited capacity. For load tests or larger clusters, explicitly review CPU, memory, MVM count, and create-concurrency limits.

## How CubeMaster selects a compute node

For each sandbox create request, scheduling roughly follows four steps:

1. **Resolve request constraints**: read `instance_type`, template ID, resource requirements, explicit host IPs, node affinity / annotations, and similar constraints.
2. **Filter nodes**: remove unhealthy nodes, stale metric nodes, nodes over MVM limits, nodes without local template replicas, nodes with too many real-time or locally observed creates, nodes that do not satisfy affinity, and, when the disk filter or backoff path is active, nodes with high disk usage.
3. **Score nodes**: score remaining candidates, for example using weighted `mvm_num`, `local_create_num`, `quota_cpu_usage`, and `quota_mem_usage`.
4. **Pick the final node**: choose from the highest-scored candidate set. `priority_select_num` controls how many top nodes are eligible for final random selection, and `least_select_name` defaults to `random`.

Without scoring, CubeMaster still filters nodes but may choose from the filtered order, which can concentrate new sandboxes on the first eligible node until resource filters push traffic elsewhere.

## Key scheduler fields

Merge the following scoring fields into the existing `scheduler` section of `cubemaster.yaml`. Keep your existing `filter`, timeout, and instance-type-specific settings unless you intentionally want to replace them.

```yaml
scheduler:
  # Keep your existing filter, timeout, and other scheduler settings.
  priority_select_num: 3
  score:
    enable_scorers:
      - real_time_weighted_average
    resource_weights:
      mvm_num: 2
      local_create_num: 3
      quota_cpu_usage: 1
      quota_mem_usage: 1
    plugin_conf:
      real_time_weighted_average:
        weight: 1.0
        enable_weight_factors:
          - mvm_num
          - local_create_num
          - quota_cpu_usage
          - quota_mem_usage
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `priority_select_num` | Final selection is made from the top N scored nodes. Use a value greater than `1` for multi-node clusters; `3` is a good starting point for small clusters. |
| `metric_update_timeout` | Treat resource metrics as stale after this duration. It should be much larger than the Cubelet report interval. |
| `local_metric_update_timeout` | Reserved local-metric timeout field. Current prefilter logic gates both global and local metric freshness with `metric_update_timeout`. |
| `filter.enable_filters` | Enables scheduling filters. Common filters include CPU, memory, template locality, and real-time create concurrency. |
| `score.enable_scorers` | Enables scoring plugins. Multi-node deployments usually enable `real_time_weighted_average`; when it is enabled, the matching `score.plugin_conf.real_time_weighted_average` block is required or CubeMaster can panic during scheduler startup. The same rule applies to `external_http_score`: listing it under `enable_scorers` requires a matching `score.plugin_conf.external_http_score` block. |
| `score.resource_weights` | Controls the influence of MVM count, create concurrency, CPU quota usage, and memory quota usage. Higher weight means stronger influence; factors must also be listed under `score.plugin_conf.real_time_weighted_average.enable_weight_factors`. |
| `score.plugin_conf.external_http_score` | Optional HTTP sidecar scorer. See [External HTTP score plugin](#external-http-score-plugin). |
| `score.enable_scorers` | Enables scoring plugins. Multi-node deployments usually enable `real_time_weighted_average`. Listing a factor/affinity scorer without its `plugin_conf` block fails config load (empty Profile included; `binpack_score` may omit the block and use defaults). With a non-empty `scheduler.profile`, factor scorers also need known `enable_weight_factors` and a positive factor weight or config load fails. |
| `score.resource_weights` | Controls the influence of MVM count, create concurrency, CPU quota usage, and memory quota usage. Higher weight means stronger influence; factors must also be listed under `score.plugin_conf.real_time_weighted_average.enable_weight_factors`. Profile overlays merge same keys over this map (Profile wins). Factor names must match the allowlist (`quota_cpu_usage`, `cpu_util`, … — not typos such as `cpu_usage`); under a non-empty Profile an unrecognized factor in `enable_weight_factors` fails config load. Grep existing configs for drifted names before selecting a Profile. |
| `score.plugin_conf.binpack_score` | Optional plugin-only scorer that prefers fuller nodes. Omitting the block while listing `binpack_score` in `enable_scorers` enables safe defaults (plugin weight 1, equal CPU/mem/MVM). Plugin `weight` is a pointer: omit → default 1; explicit `0` disables Select; negatives are rejected at config load. Sub-weights `cpu_weight`/`mem_weight`/`mvm_weight` remain plain floats: `<= 0` fall back to default `1` (cannot exclude a dimension via `0`); negatives are rejected at config load. |
| `profile` / `profiles` | Optional runtime Profile overlay. Empty `profile` leaves Filter/Score unchanged. Built-ins: `balanced_spread`, `template_locality_first`, `binpack_utilization`. User same-name keys override built-ins. Runtime Profiles are selector overlays, not offline simulator models. See [Scheduler Profile Configuration Example](../dev/scheduler-profile-config-example.md). |
| `node_max_mvm_num` / `node_max_mvm_num_conf` | Global or per-instance-type single-node MVM limits. Cubelet-reported `max_mvm_num` also participates in the effective limit. |
| `disk_usage_max_percent` | Threshold used by the `disk` filter and backoff path to avoid placing more sandboxes on nearly full machines. |
| `affinityconf` / `node_affinity_selector_allowed_keys` | Controls affinity and constraints by cluster label, zone, CPU type, instance type, and other allowed selector keys. |

## Runtime Profiles and binpack_score

CubeMaster can select a named **runtime Profile** with `scheduler.profile`.
Empty profile leaves the existing Filter/Score lists and `plugin_conf`
blocks in place. That is not a byte-for-byte freeze of master behavior:
`plugin_conf.<scorer>.weight: 0` still disables that scorer. The async
`loopAsyncScore` feeder (writer of `node.Score` / `pscore`) starts only when
the `multi_factor_weighted_average` plugin block is present **and**
`score.resource_weights` is non-nil — matching master's early-return when
`resource_weights` was omitted. Built-in names (`balanced_spread`,
`template_locality_first`, `binpack_utilization`) expand onto selector lists
and inject self-contained plugin defaults when the matching `plugin_conf`
block is absent. User entries under `scheduler.profiles` with the same name
override a built-in entirely.

**Warning:** when a Profile provides `filter.enable_filters`, that list
**replaces** the base `scheduler.filter.enable_filters` (no merge). User
Profiles that drop base filters fail config load unless
`allow_dropped_filters: true`. Built-in presets already allow drops so stock
four-filter configs can select them by name; still audit effective filters if
you relied on `disk` / `thirtparty`.

## Upgrade notes (empty Profile / restart)

These Init checks run even with `scheduler.profile` empty and **exit CubeMaster
on process start** (hot-reload only logs FATAL and keeps the previous Config):

- `enable_scorers` lists a factor/affinity scorer without its `plugin_conf` block
- any `plugin_conf.<scorer>.weight < 0`

Configs that previously started with a silent unscored phase or inverted
ranking will not boot until those YAML issues are fixed.

For every Score plugin (including the four existing scorers and
`binpack_score`), `plugin_conf.<scorer>.weight: 0` disables the scorer and
skips Select. **Negative** `plugin_conf.<scorer>.weight` is rejected at config
load for every registered scorer (not only `binpack_score`); configs that
previously started with a negative weight will fail `config.Init` after
upgrade. For `binpack_score` specifically, `weight` is a pointer field:
omitting `weight` inside a present `plugin_conf.binpack_score` block keeps
the runtime default of `1` (enabled); only an explicit `0` disables. Other
scorers still use plain `float64`, so omitting `weight` there YAML-decodes
to `0` and disables — set an explicit positive `weight` to keep them
active. Listing a factor/affinity scorer in `enable_scorers` without its
`plugin_conf` block also fails config load (empty Profile included);
`binpack_score` may omit the block and use runtime defaults. Profile /
selector-list changes require a CubeMaster restart: config hot-reload re-runs
`preHandle` and, on success, updates the in-memory Config. On failure it logs
FATAL (CubeLog.Fatalf does **not** `os.Exit`) and keeps the previous Config —
the bad Profile overlay is not applied. `InitScheduler` still does not rebuild
Filter/Score slices on reload, so selector-set changes need a process restart.

`binpack_score` is a thin Score-phase plugin that prefers fuller nodes. It is
enabled by listing `binpack_score` in `enable_scorers` (directly or via a
Profile). Plugin params stay under `scheduler.score.plugin_conf.binpack_score`.
Do not mix `binpack_score` with spread-style scorers (`real_time_weighted_average`,
`multi_factor_weighted_average`) in the same `enable_scorers` list: binpack
returns occupancy (higher = fuller) while those scorers return remaining-capacity
style scores, so the blend can cancel. Under a non-empty `scheduler.profile`
that mix fails config load; with an empty Profile it still loads (pre-upgrade
compat) but ranking is near-noise. Built-in `binpack_utilization` only enables
`binpack_score`.

Runtime Profiles are **not** offline simulator / `schedulerbench` models, even
when they reuse the same preset name strings. Copyable YAML and the full
contract: [Scheduler Profile Configuration Example](../dev/scheduler-profile-config-example.md).

## How node metadata affects scheduling

Cubelet registers nodes and continuously reports status through CubeOps's `/internal/v1/node-agent` API. CubeOps persists this metadata to MySQL/Redis; CubeMaster syncs the node view from CubeOps every few seconds and keeps local cache snapshots for scheduling.

| Cubelet-reported field | Source | Scheduling effect |
|------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| `instance_type` | Cubelet node identity / instance type | Matches request `instance_type`, selects template replicas, and applies type-specific MVM settings. |
| `cluster_label` | `host.scheduler_label` | Used for cluster-label affinity and node-pool isolation. |
| `quota_cpu` | `host.quota.mcpu_limit` or derived from host resources | Schedulable CPU capacity used by CPU filtering and scoring. |
| `quota_mem_mb` | `host.quota.mem_limit` or derived from host resources | Schedulable memory capacity used by memory filtering and scoring. |
| `max_mvm_num` | `host.quota.mvm_limit` or memory-derived default | Single-node MVM limit. Nodes at the limit are filtered out. |
| `create_concurrent_num` | `host.quota.creation_concurrent_num` | Reported per-node create concurrency. `0` means Cubelet does not set an additional engine flow limit, but CubeMaster scheduling still falls back to `cubelet_conf.create_concurrent_limit`. |
| allocated / disk usage / cgroup metrics | Periodic Cubelet reports | Used for current resource usage, disk watermarks, and scoring factors. |

These values are configured and reported per compute node. Heterogeneous clusters can use different instance types, labels, quota, and create-concurrency limits on different nodes.

## Deployment variable mapping

### one-click multi-node

| Variable / config | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| `ONE_CLICK_DEPLOY_ROLE=compute` | Installs a compute node, runs Cubelet/runtime services, and registers to the control plane. |
| `CUBE_SANDBOX_NODE_IP` | Routable address registered for this node. Incorrect values can make the node unreachable or invisible. |
| `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` / `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_CUBEOPS_ADDR` | CubeOps endpoint used by Cubelet for registration and reports (port 3010). CubeMaster is reachable separately on 8089. |
| `node_status_update_frequency` in `Cubelet/config/config.toml` | Node status/resource report interval. Default is `1s`; do not put this in dynamic config. |
| `host.scheduler_label` in `Cubelet/dynamicconf/conf.yaml` | Node-pool label for affinity and isolation. |
| `host.quota.*` in `Cubelet/dynamicconf/conf.yaml` | CPU, memory, MVM count, and create-concurrency scheduling capacity. |

### Tencent Cloud Terraform / TKE

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `TENCENTCLOUD_COMPUTE_NODE_COUNT` | Number of PVM compute nodes, directly controlling the sandbox-hosting node-pool size. |
| `TENCENTCLOUD_COMPUTE_INSTANCE_TYPE` | Default compute-node instance type, affecting real CPU/memory and Cubelet-derived quota. |
| `TF_VAR_compute_instance_types` | Per-node instance types for heterogeneous compute pools. |
| `TENCENTCLOUD_COMPUTE_DATA_DISK_SIZE` | Data disk size for `/data/cubelet`, affecting template, snapshot, and runtime-data capacity. |
| `TENCENTCLOUD_CUBELET_NODE_STATUS_UPDATE_FREQUENCY` | Written into each compute node's Cubelet static config; controls node status/resource reporting cadence. |
| `TENCENTCLOUD_TKE_NODE_COUNT` / `TENCENTCLOUD_TKE_WORKER_INSTANCE_TYPE` | Control-plane Pod resources. They do not host sandboxes directly, but affect cube-master, cube-api, cube-proxy, and overall control-plane throughput. |

`TENCENTCLOUD_COMPUTE_NODE_COUNT` and `TENCENTCLOUD_TKE_NODE_COUNT` are separate resources: the former runs Cubelet and hosts sandboxes, while the latter runs control-plane Pods.

## Recommended configurations

### Small test cluster

Suitable for POC, functional validation, and low concurrency. This is a complete starting point for a new small test cluster and includes the shipped timeout/filter defaults; when updating an existing deployment, merge these values instead of replacing unrelated scheduler settings blindly.

```yaml
scheduler:
  priority_select_num: 3
  metric_update_timeout: 300s
  local_metric_update_timeout: 300s
  filter:
    enable_filters:
      - cpu
      - mem
      - template_locality
      - realtime_create_num
  score:
    enable_scorers:
      - real_time_weighted_average
    resource_weights:
      mvm_num: 2
      local_create_num: 3
      quota_cpu_usage: 1
      quota_mem_usage: 1
    plugin_conf:
      real_time_weighted_average:
        weight: 1.0
        enable_weight_factors:
          - mvm_num
          - local_create_num
          - quota_cpu_usage
          - quota_mem_usage
```

Recommendations:

- Use at least 2 compute nodes so node selection and failure isolation can be validated.
- Start with `priority_select_num: 3`; if the cluster has fewer than 3 compute nodes, set it to the node count.
- Keep Cubelet reporting at the default `1s` and CubeMaster metric timeouts at `300s`.
- Default-derived `host.quota` is acceptable for basic validation, but inspect it before load testing.

### Larger production-like cluster

For higher concurrency or long-running environments:

- Set clear `host.scheduler_label` values per node pool, such as general, memory-heavy, or load-test pools.
- Configure `node_max_mvm_num_conf` per `instance_type`; avoid using one limit for both large and small nodes.
- Increase `priority_select_num` to a small fraction of healthy compute nodes, but avoid making final selection fully random.
- Keep the `template_locality` filter enabled so creation only lands on nodes with usable template replicas.
- Set explicit `host.quota.creation_concurrent_num` values to avoid a burst of image, disk, or VMM work overloading a single node.
- Scale the control plane as well: increase `TENCENTCLOUD_TKE_NODE_COUNT` and relevant control-plane replicas so CubeMaster or cube-api does not become the bottleneck.

## Template redo after adding compute nodes

After a new compute node is added, successful node registration does not mean every template is available on that node. The `template_locality` filter requires a usable local template replica on the target node, so creates may fail or continue to land only on older nodes until templates are synchronized.

For image-built templates, run template redo after adding a node:

```bash
cubemastercli tpl redo \
  --template-id <tpl-id> \
  --node <node-ip>
```

Notes:

- `--node` accepts a node ID or host IP; repeat it for multiple nodes.
- `redo` waits for completion by default; use `--detach` to submit and exit.
- Use `--failed-only` to redo only failed nodes.
- Wait for the redo job to complete before creating sandboxes from that template on the new node.

Recommended scale-out flow:

1. Install the compute node and confirm it appears in the CubeMaster node list.
2. Confirm the node is healthy and Cubelet resource reports are fresh.
3. Run `cubemastercli tpl redo --template-id <tpl-id> --node <node-ip>` for templates that should run on the new node.
4. Wait for redo jobs to succeed before opening traffic or running E2E tests.

## Troubleshooting

### Scheduling fails or returns no more resource

Check:

- Whether `quota_cpu` / `quota_mem_mb` are lower than the requested resources.
- Whether `host.quota.mcpu_limit`, `host.quota.mem_limit`, and `host.quota.mvm_limit` still use low derived defaults.
- Whether `mvm_num` reached `max_mvm_num` or `node_max_mvm_num_conf`.
- Whether the effective create concurrency limit is blocking the node. Remember that `create_concurrent_num: 0` still falls back to CubeMaster's `cubelet_conf.create_concurrent_limit` at the scheduler layer.

Useful entry points:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3010/internal/v1/nodes
sudo tail -F /data/log/CubeMaster/cubemaster-req.log
sudo tail -F /data/log/Cubelet/Cubelet-req.log
```

### Node status or resource reports are stale

If CubeMaster logs mention metric update timeouts:

- Confirm `cube-sandbox-cubelet.service` is running on the compute node.
- Confirm `ONE_CLICK_CONTROL_PLANE_CUBEOPS_ADDR` or the Terraform-generated CubeOps endpoint is reachable from the compute node.
- Check whether `node_status_update_frequency` was accidentally set too high.
- Ensure `metric_update_timeout` is much larger than the report interval.

### Template unavailable

Typical symptoms: new sandboxes still land only on old nodes after scale-out, or logs mention unavailable local template replicas.

Fix:

- Confirm the request's `template_id`.
- Run `cubemastercli tpl redo --template-id <tpl-id> --node <node-ip>` for the new node.
- Check the template job status and confirm redo succeeds.
- Keep the `template_locality` filter enabled; do not disable it as a workaround.

### Node label mismatch

If a request uses node affinity, cluster labels, or a specific instance type but no candidate node remains:

- Check that Cubelet `host.scheduler_label` matches the request or `affinityconf`.
- Check that `instance_type` matches the template and request.
- Check that `node_affinity_selector_allowed_keys` allows the selector key used by the request.
- For heterogeneous node pools, confirm template replicas have been redone onto the target label / instance-type pool.

### Creates concentrate on only a few nodes

If new sandboxes still concentrate on one machine in a multi-node cluster:

- Confirm `score.enable_scorers` is enabled.
- Confirm `score.plugin_conf.real_time_weighted_average.enable_weight_factors` includes the expected factors when `real_time_weighted_average` is enabled.
- Set `priority_select_num` to a value greater than `1`.
- Check that weights for `local_create_num`, `mvm_num`, `quota_cpu_usage`, and `quota_mem_usage` are configured.
- Confirm templates are available on all intended nodes; otherwise `template_locality` shrinks the candidate set.

## External HTTP score plugin

`external_http_score` is an opt-in scoring plugin. When it appears in
`score.enable_scorers`, CubeMaster POSTs a snapshot of the **current candidate
node list** (after filters) to an operator-configured HTTP endpoint and blends
the returned per-node scores into the weighted score sum. Enabling
`enable_scorers: external_http_score` **requires** a matching
`score.plugin_conf.external_http_score` block; otherwise CubeMaster panics while
constructing scorers at startup (same pattern as `real_time_weighted_average`).

### Configuration

Current CubeMaster scorer loading requires a non-nil `score.resource_weights`
map before it processes `enable_scorers` (including a standalone
`external_http_score`). This is a **loader prerequisite**, not part of the
HTTP wire protocol: if `resource_weights` is omitted, CubeMaster builds an
empty scorer list and the sidecar is never contacted. The entry below is a
valid existing weight key; `external_http_score` does not consume it.

```yaml
scheduler:
  score:
    enable_scorers:
      - external_http_score
    resource_weights:
      mvm_num: 1
    plugin_conf:
      external_http_score:
        weight: 1.0
        endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:18080/score"
        timeout: 200ms   # optional; default 200ms when zero/omitted
        mode: ""         # optional opaque string forwarded to the sidecar
        disable: false
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `weight` | Relative weight in `runScoreFilter`'s weighted average (`Σ(score × weight) / Σ(weight)`). Returned scores must use the same **`[0, 100]`** scale as built-in scorers; a sidecar that returns normalised `0.0–1.0` values contributes ~1% of a built-in scorer at equal weight. **Omitted** `weight` defaults to **`1.0`** once at config load / hot-reload (`preHandle`). An **explicit** `weight: 0` is a staged inert no-op like `disable: true`: `Select` returns immediately without requiring a valid endpoint and without emitting `empty_endpoint` / HTTP failure signals. Use `disable: true` when you want the plugin off while keeping a real endpoint configured. Negative / non-finite weights are detected at construction (one Warn) and then fail-open on each `Select` — CubeMaster still starts. Read live from `plugin_conf` on each `Weight()` / `Select` (hot-reload applies without restart); `runScoreFilter` samples `Weight()` once **before** `Select` so a mid-attempt reload cannot mix generations when blending. |
| `endpoint` | Sidecar URL. Empty endpoint (including whitespace-only) with a **positive** weight fail-opens with a rate-limited Warn (log category `empty_endpoint`) and increments `cube_scheduler_external_http_score_outcomes_total{reason="other"}` — it does not silently skip. With `weight: 0` or `disable: true` the empty check is not reached. Non-empty values must be absolute `http://` or `https://` URLs with a host; missing scheme, `file://`, `unix://`, and other schemes are detected at construction (one Warn) and then fail-open on each `Select` (CubeMaster still starts). Leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed before the request. Prefer putting secrets in the sidecar itself rather than in the URL; if userinfo or query tokens are present, the scorer never logs them, and the `config.Init` cfg dump redacts them to scheme/host/path only. |
| `timeout` | Per-request HTTP timeout on the **synchronous create path**. Zero/omitted uses the default **200ms**. Positive values must be **≥ 1ms** and **≤ 2s**; negative values, sub-millisecond positives, and values above **2s** are detected at construction (one Warn) and then fail-open on each `Select` (not silently coerced; CubeMaster still starts). Use a duration string such as `200ms` / `1s` — a bare integer like `timeout: 200` is parsed as **200 nanoseconds** by YAML and fails the ≥1ms check. A hung sidecar can add up to this budget to every create attempt before fail-open. |
| `mode` | Optional operator-defined mode string included in the JSON request. |
| `disable` | When true, the plugin is a no-op even if enabled in `enable_scorers`. Read live like `weight`. Removing the entire `plugin_conf.external_http_score` block while leaving the name in `enable_scorers` also stops scoring, but emits a rate-limited fail-open Warn (log category `plugin_conf_absent`) and increments `cube_scheduler_external_http_score_outcomes_total{reason="other"}` (scorer instances survive hot-reload). Prefer `disable: true` for a live off switch; removing the name from `enable_scorers` only takes effect after a CubeMaster restart. |

### Wire contract

Request (`POST`, `Content-Type: application/json`):

| Field | Units / notes |
|-------|----------------|
| `mode` | Optional string from config. |
| `instance_type` | Request instance type. |
| `template_id` | Request template id when present. |
| `nodes[]` | Candidate set passed into the scorer after filters; one entry per node. |
| `nodes[].node_id` | Node identity; every requested candidate must appear in `scores`. |
| `nodes[].quota_cpu` / `quota_mem` | Capacity counters from the node snapshot. |
| `nodes[].quota_cpu_usage` / `quota_mem_usage` | **Raw** reported usage counters (not `EffectiveAllocated`). When `ignore_redis_allocation: true`, built-in scorers may treat allocated usage as 0 while these wire fields still carry the raw Redis-reported values. |
| other `nodes[]` fields | `mvm_num`, create counters, `cpu_util`, `mem_usage`, IPs/types as available on the snapshot. |

Response:

```json
{ "scores": { "node-a": 10.0, "node-b": 90.0 } }
```

- `scores` must include **every** requested candidate `node_id`. Additional keys
  are ignored (they do not fail the response); only the ignored-key **count** may
  be logged, never the key names or body. Extra keys with JSON `null` or
  out-of-range numbers are ignored the same way.
- Each score for a known candidate must be a **non-null** finite number in
  **`[0, 100]`** (numeric `0` is valid; JSON `null` is not). Higher is better
  (same direction as built-in scorers). Non-numeric JSON values (string, object,
  array) anywhere under `scores` make the response malformed at decode time.
- Response bodies larger than **1 MiB** are rejected; HTTP redirects are not followed.

### Failure / fallback semantics

Scorer failures (timeout, non-2xx, redirect, malformed/oversized body, validation
errors) return an error from the plugin. `runScoreFilter` skips failed scorers
and continues scheduling (**fail-open** for sandbox creation). Outcomes increment
`cube_scheduler_external_http_score_outcomes_total{reason=...}` (including
`reason="success"`) and HTTP round-trips also observe
`cube_scheduler_external_http_score_request_duration_seconds{reason=...}`.
Fixed `reason` values: `success`, `timeout`, `connection`, `http_status`,
`invalid_json`, `missing_candidate`, `other` (config / generic failures such as
empty endpoint, invalid weight, or unclassified errors land in `other`). Failures
are logged at the scorer boundary without endpoint URLs, URL userinfo, query
tokens, or request/response bodies; Warn is rate-limited to about one line per
sanitized failure category per minute (further failures stay at Debug) so a down
sidecar does not flood create-path logs. Missing scores for any requested
candidate fail the whole attempt (anti-bias: scoring only a subset would
systematically skew ranking). The call is **synchronous** on the create path.
The shared HTTP transport does **not** honor `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` /
`ALL_PROXY` (direct dial only, so env proxies cannot see token-bearing sidecar
URLs or the node inventory body) and caps in-flight sidecar connections with
`MaxConnsPerHost = 8` (same as the idle pool per host) so a hung sidecar cannot
open an unbounded dial storm; each attempt may still wait up to `timeout`
(default 200ms, max 2s) before fail-open. This PR does not add a circuit breaker,
negative cache, async execution, or retry loop — those remain follow-ups for
higher create QPS deployments.
